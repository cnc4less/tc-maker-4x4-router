## Guides
This folder contains the original guides that were created and provided by Pete McKenna for both the 4x4' CNC machine and the nearby 2x2' CNC machine. They are no longer completely accurate and should not be relied upon for using the machines with their current workflows, but I'm adding them to this repo for reference and posterity.

Newer guides will be created over on the [project wiki](https://github.com/jasonwebb/tc-maker-4x4-router/wiki). So far the following guides are available or planned:
1. CAD/CAM workflow notes
2. Running a job - machine setup
3. Running a job - securing workpieces to the spoilboard
4. Running a job - using LinuxCNC

These guides will probably also be made available in a print-friendly PDF format once they are complete.

If you have any requests for guides, or have resources and information you'd like to share, or would like to help in creating content, please contact me at [zen.webb@gmail.com](zen.webb@gmail.com)!
